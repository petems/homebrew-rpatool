# homebrew-rpatool

A homebrew formula for installing `rpatools` on OSX.

Currently the repo doesn't have any tagging or versioning, so it's a HEAD only formula for now

## How do I install this formula?

```bash
$ brew tap petems/rpatool
$ brew install petems/rpatool/rpatool --HEAD
```

Or directly via the URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petems/homebrew-rpatool/master/Formula/rpatool.rb --HEAD
```

Or if you're testing changes locally:
```
brew install ./Formula/rpatool.rb --HEAD
```

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).
